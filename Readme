This repository contains the code for an Ocean Front Prediction Model, designed to predict the occurrence and movement of ocean fronts using oceanographic data and machine learning techniques. The model leverages historical data, satellite imagery, and oceanographic parameters to make accurate predictions that are vital for understanding marine ecosystems and supporting navigation and fisheries management.

Dataset: Bohai dataset, kuroshio dataset

Evaluation Method: F_Score

Comparison Method：CNN， LSTM， ConvLSTM

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model architecture)
Matplotlib
Cartopy (for map visualizations)
NetCDF4 (for handling oceanographic data)
